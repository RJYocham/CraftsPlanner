# Rhi-Create

A play on my name, Rhiannan, and the word recreate. I enjoying making various crafts inspired by media and pop-culture, so the word recreate was only fitting. I use multiple planning resources when I make my projects, but none of them have all of the features I like and want. This is my attempt at bringing all of those features together.

## Description

In its current state, its just a list maker. You can create a "Project," and within that project create custom lists to represent anything from a shopping list to a to-do list. You can then add tasks/items to said list, and mark them complete.

## Structure
### Projects
Create a project with only a Name and a source. A source is just whatever inspired the project.
### PGroup
PGroup is a List that contains "elements." It is named as such to prevent any confusion in the code.
### Element
Element is a task that can be added to a List.

## Roadmap

Eventually I would like to add the ability to organize projects by assigned categories, and pull lists of projects based on multiple categories. I would also like to add the ability to keep track of progress and upload photos.
